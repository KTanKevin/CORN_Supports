/**
 * This example, like all Swing examples, exists in a package:
 * in this case, the "start" package.
 * If you are using an IDE, such as NetBeans, this should work 
 * seamlessly.  If you are compiling and running the examples
 * from the command-line, this may be confusing if you aren't
 * used to using named packages.  In most cases,
 * the quick and dirty solution is to delete or comment out
 * the "package" line from all the source files and the code
 * should work as expected.  For an explanation of how to
 * use the Swing examples as-is from the command line, see
 * http://docs.oracle.com/javase/javatutorials/tutorial/uiswing/start/compile.html#package
